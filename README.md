# User Management Angular Demo

Angular v21 application demonstrating routing, reactive forms, and frontend-only state management using Angular signals (`signal()`, `input()`).

State is kept in-memory via a service (survives page navigation). A localStorage persistence option is shown in code but disabled (commented) by default.

UI built with PrimeNG components/icons; dialogs handle add/edit/view, and deletes are confirmed.

```bash
npm install
npm start  # or ng serve
```

Then open http://localhost:4200/.
